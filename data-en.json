    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar inquired about his prospects for official rank and drew this lot. He believed he was destined for either Huiyuan (top provincial examinee) or Zhuangyuan (top imperial examinee) status, yet it was only after a long time that he finally succeeded. In both the metropolitan and palace examinations, when ranked among all successful candidates (often by age for the same cohort), he was always first. He was appointed to an official post in Shandong, and from county magistrate, he progressed through positions in prefectures, departments, circuits, up to provincial governor, never leaving Shandong. This aligns with the last line of the prophecy, 'your fortune as boundless as the Eastern Sea, your lifespan like the mighty mountains,' signifying deep roots and stability.",

If you ask of your future path and final resting place, know that further cultivation of your heart and mind is paramount.",
    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A youth suffering from a debilitating illness drew this lot and subsequently passed away, ultimately 'abandoning the human world.' This corresponded to the phrase 'future path leads to a shortened land/destination.'\n\nAnother person, asking about a traveler, drew this lot. Within a few days, the traveler arrived, having journeyed with great speed, also an instance of 'shortened land/destination' (as in rapid travel).\n\nYet another person, inquiring about their profession, drew this lot. They wandered far and wide without a stable livelihood. Later, they met a master of elective arts who imparted esoteric methods. They then retired to Xunjiang (now Yagou Village, Longhu Town, Jinjiang City), opened a date-selection consultancy, and became quite skilled in the arts of seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune. The first two lines of the prophecy proved very accurate.",
    "整体运程": "Do you feel that past difficulties are about to dissipate? Now is a turning point, and things will become smoother. Inner cultivation is key to guiding your future; virtuous thoughts are like a lighthouse, illuminating the path ahead.

    "远古预言": "Sustenance and livelihood arise naturally from their destined sources; I urge you not to toil your heart with excessive worry. If you can uphold filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness, blessings and prosperity will come, and misfortune will not encroach.",
    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar who failed an examination but was talented drew this lot and was subsequently accepted. This corresponds to the line 'Sustenance and livelihood arise naturally from their destined sources,' as the official examination system is the 'source' of a scholar's livelihood.\n\nAnother case from the Daoguang era (Qing Dynasty): A man, relying on his wealth, sought to purchase an official title and had already donated for the rank of 'Tongzhi' (Subprefect). One day, he suddenly desired to be assigned a position in Zhejiang and came to the temple to draw this lot. People advised him to remain a wealthy gentleman, but he refused. He then went to that province to await appointment, scheming in every way, and finally obtained a post. However, due to many delays, he had not yet departed when the high officials reprimanded him for tardiness and his appointment was rescinded and reassigned. After several years of toil, his money was exhausted, his clothes tattered, and he died in a lodging away from home, unable to return. This reflects the first two lines of the prophecy.",
    "整体运程": "Do you often feel that many things in life seem predestined? Perhaps going with the flow is the best strategy.

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar taking a supplementary examination drew this and was not selected, corresponding to 'why bother with divinations by tiles.'\n\nAnother scholar, after an injury, drew this and was ranked twenty-second. The winter solstice in the eleventh lunar month marks the time before the first Yang energy fully returns, and '车見 (che jian - seeing carts/being seen by vehicle)' sounds like '二十二 (er shi er - twenty-two)'. This fulfilled the third line.",
    "整体运程": "You may be experiencing a period of low fortune, feeling that things are not going well and you are physically and mentally exhausted. Excessive divinations or struggles at this time may be fruitless; what is needed more is inner reflection and patiently waiting for the right moment.

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar going to the provincial capital for a supplementary examination drew this and was not selected. Upon returning home, lacking a horse, he walked, fulfilling 'spirit turning to sorrow.'\n\nTwo merchants went together to a tea mountain to procure tea. After years of losses, they were undecided about closing down and asked someone to draw this lot for them. One was advised to try again and believed it; the other refused and they split their partnership. The one who took his capital home fell ill midway and was still lodging alone at year's end, the last line proving very accurate. The one who reorganized, it happened that the tea harvest was poor, and people were too fearful to buy. He alone bought extensively and indeed made a huge profit; however, when he tried to resell to foreign ships, he failed. The entire poem applied. The last line 'In the end, you stand alone' was extremely accurate, and the words 'spirit turning to sorrow' were particularly apt.",

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar asked about his lifelong prospects and drew this lot. He remained without success for a long time. In his later years, he was hired as a tutor by an official family from Huai'an and gained substantially. Their home was by the Qingjiang River, and only then did he realize the prophecy's accuracy.\n\nAnother person crossed from Quanzhou to Taiwan to collect debts. When leaving, he promised his wife he would return in two or three months. However, he did not return for years, and his wife sent someone to draw this lot. When he finally came home, the number of months he had been away matched the years of a shepherd's tale (a pun on 'years' and 'sheep'), fitting the prophecy's巧 (qiao - cleverness/coincidence) so precisely.\n\nIn the Gengchen year of Guangxu's reign (1880), during the imperial examination, a Mr. Lin and three friends drew this lot together. Guessing the order of the results, only Lin was admitted. Because he was the eldest, the prophecy's mention of 'a lifetime' referred to him as the first or primary one.",
    "整体运程": "Do you feel that plans are not keeping up with changes, and many expectations have fallen through while waiting? The time is not yet ripe.

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A Xiaolian (provincial graduate) drew this lot before the metropolitan examination. Someone interpreted it: 'You will not succeed. Great joy will be met with extraordinary misfortune, judging by 'above tens of thousands.'' On the day of the examination, he was pushed down by the crowd, fell, and was trampled to death.\n\nAnother scholar, in a Jiawu year (year ending in 4, with Jia stem), divined for the autumn imperial examination. It was predicted he would succeed, saying this examination, falling in Jiawu, would bring success, and he would pass the imperial civil service examinations. It turned out as predicted, corresponding to 'Jia not yet found success' (implying it was about to change).\n\nIn the third year of Guangxu's reign (a Ding year, but the interpretation focuses on Rabbit), Mr. Zhang of Jinjiang County had two sons taking an exam. The father drew this lot. When the results were posted, only the second son, born in a Rabbit year, was admitted. This fulfilled the line 'When the Jade Rabbit is reborn.'",

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar drew this for the autumn imperial examination but failed, as 'quite favorable' is not yet 'extremely favorable.' After the exam, being of age, he was recommended for a minor official post, which was auspicious.\n\nMy late elder brother, styled Qingguang, drew this lot for the Jihai year (year with Jihai stem-branch) examination. He interpreted 'birth of a noble son' as having a son, which was already fulfilled, and indeed he was admitted as a county student. On New Year's Day of Guichou (year with Guichou stem-branch) in the Xianfeng era, he drew this lot again and reinterpreted 'birth of a noble son' as his life being complete. Indeed, he passed away in March of that year.\n\nMy disciple Wang Jingxing also drew this lot and was admitted. Thus, it is auspicious for young students. For imperial examinations, success is often met in years with the 'Wei' (未) earthly branch, corresponding to 'not yet obtained the time' (implying it's coming).",

This corresponds to 'worldly affairs flow away like water.'\n\nIn the Guangxu era, a scholar from Anxi County taking an annual examination drew this lot and was only barely accepted, ranking eighteenth. This corresponds to the second line (eighteen rapids).\n\nMr. Guo of Jinjiang County asked which of his two sons would be admitted to the local academy. He drew this, and both failed.

Later, the daughter-in-law, speaking deliriously (or through a medium), said: 'In my previous life, I was a thief. All I stole, I pawned at your shop. Now I've come to enjoy your wealth. Quickly make offerings to the gods, and I can be safe.' It turned out as she said.\n\nAnother scholar plagiarized an essay and fraudulently passed an examination. Because his writing in the re-examination was vastly different, he was nearly dismissed. Later, the chief examiner, having taken his essay and read it several times, couldn't bear to fail him, and he ultimately passed without incident. He then understood the prophecy clearly stated, 'With you, an old enmity was formed in past lives,' and had no other worries.

Later, he entered the examination hall and was assigned a seat with the character '空 (kong - empty)' and subsequently passed. This corresponds to 'all things turn to emptiness.' The sacred poems are subtle and not easily fathomed by people.\n\nIn Quanzhou city, a Mr. Guo's son fell ill. He consulted two doctors, one named Rongguan, the other Jinxian. They disputed over whether the illness was due to cold or heat, so he went to the temple and drew this lot.

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: In the Jiangdong divine temple, there was a large tree. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty wished to fell it. He first drew this lot, thought it a coincidence, drew again, and still got this lot. He was then astonished, considered it a divine sign, and left it untouched.\n\nAnother new imperial examination graduate drew this and achieved great success in the spring imperial civil service examination, corresponding to 'step by step.' If asking about a single examination, it is unfavorable.\n\nMy kinsman, Wang Sheng, drew this for an annual examination. He was assigned to the East corridor examination hall, neighboring a Jiang Sheng. He understood the essay topic well and indeed was admitted. Another scholar also drew this and was admitted. The first three lines are not explicit; 'naturally endowed' (自天生) contains three characters. The concluding six characters subtly hide a '员 (yuan - official/member)' meaning. Respectfully noted by Wang Qian.",

In the Yihai year of Guangxu's reign (1875), before taking the academy exam, he prayed at the temple and drew this lot, believing he had no hope. When the results were posted, he was surprisingly admitted. As he was quite poor and wanted to make a blue scholar's gown but lacked the means, he borrowed an old one from relatives.

In autumn, he happened to arrange a marriage with a poor scholar, taking his daughter as a daughter-in-law. Later, her family became prominent and wealthy, and this man and his son consequently became rich.\n\nAnother case from Quanzhou: A Mr. Lin drew this lot when asking about his financial prospects. Shortly after, a merchant named Guo Qiuqi and an employee of a Lin family shop died by suicide for no apparent reason. Mr. Lin, being of the same clan, stepped in to mediate and received two hundred taels of silver as a reward.

However, during the Tianqi Jiazi year (1624) imperial examination in Shandong, three individuals drew this lot together, thinking none would pass. Later, all three succeeded. The top graduate was named Ding Yi. They then realized the first two characters of the lot number (三十二, 32, sounds like '丁乙 Ding Yi' in some dialects) signified 'Ding Yi,' and the three of them were destined to be on the 'Ding Yi' list of successful candidates.\n\nIn the Tongzhi Yichou year (1865), a supplementary Jiazi provincial examination was held. The chief examiner for Fujian was Ding Shaozhou. Before the appointments were announced, a Mr. Huang from Jinjiang, whose childhood name was Tou (头, head/first), asked about his examination prospects and drew this lot, not understanding it. After passing, he realized it also fulfilled the 'Ding Yi' and '到头 (dao tou - to the end/in the end)' parts.",

When the results were posted, only Wang Sheng passed, ranking fourth as Jingkui (a high honor). This fulfilled the five characters '黄庭经一卷 (Huang Ting Jing yi juan - a scroll of the Yellow Court Scripture).'\n\nAnother scholar, Zhu Sheng, also drew this before an academy exam. He was assigned a seat in the East corridor. Someone interpreted: 'The end of each line subtly hides the characters 东廊卷通 (dong lang juan tong - East corridor scroll through/success).'

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A man's wife was ill; he drew this lot, and she subsequently died, fulfilling 'parting midway.'\n\nA geomancer, recommended to a wealthy household, found another geomancer had already arrived, fulfilling 'within the gates.' The two held differing opinions, which displeased the master, and neither was hired. They returned, fulfilling 'parting midway' and 'empty chamber.'\n\nAnother woman, less than a month postpartum, fell ill along with her child. She drew this lot, and within a few days, both died, fulfilling 'all things in pairs' and the last two lines.\n\nTwo brothers from one family were about to take an exam and drew this lot together. Both later passed and entered the local academy. The interpretation was that '谁料半 (shui liao ban - who could foresee half)' contained '隹 (zhui - bird),' and '途 (tu - path)' when its radical '辶' (movement) was removed, became '余 (yu - remainder/I)'. Combined, these resembled '进 (jin - enter/advance),' hence their admission to the academy. (This is a highly specific and complex pun based on character components, difficult to translate directly while maintaining the divinatory feel. The core idea is an unexpected positive outcome derived from deconstructing characters in the negative-sounding lines.)",

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar, son of a wealthy man, was arrogant and disrespectful to his father, repeatedly failing supplementary examinations. After drawing this lot, he repented and practiced filial piety. Both father and son lived peacefully and enjoyed longevity. Had he not changed, not only would he have failed, but misfortune would have been unavoidable. The poem's meaning is clear: rectifying faults surpasses fulfilling incense vows.\n\nDuring the Xianfeng era (Qing Dynasty), in the West Huashi Pu district of Quanzhou, during the Dragon Boat Festival, locals customarily paraded a wooden dragon head and had a dispute with people from Dongfo Pu. The magistrate heard of it and ordered strict arrests from that district. The incense at Qishi Gong temple was very prosperous, and the old nun, fearing involvement and expense, went to the temple and drew this lot. When the matter was settled, the wealthy families refused to contribute a penny; all expenses for apologies and official fees fell upon the old nun. This fulfilled the fourth line.",
    "整体运程": "You are inherently a fortunate individual, possessing a good foundation and a kind nature. However, some recent actions or decisions may have deviated, leading to spiritual depletion or setbacks.

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar, originally from Jiangxi, took an examination in Nanjing and passed at both prefectural and county levels. Someone found out and attacked him (likely through accusations), preventing him from advancing to the academy level. He drew this lot, then returned to his native place and surprisingly ranked first. This fulfilled the second and third lines.\n\nDuring the Daoguang Wuxu year (1838), my late father, styled Qiulan Gong, was about to take an academy exam and drew this lot. At the same time, the younger brother of Censor Du also drew this lot in the temple. When the results were posted, both my father and Du's brother were admitted to the county academy, fulfilling 'both' and 'are but.' Later, my father passed the higher examinations, while Du remained an academy student for life, fulfilling the final line as well. Respectfully noted by Wang Qian (with '竹' radical).",

For a provincial examination, he drew this lot and failed. However, he was originally a poor scholar from a remote area, lacking travel funds, and greatly distressed. This fulfilled 'better to ride an ox.' (Implying that the perceived 'better' option of the horse/provincial exam led to hardship, whereas the 'slower' ox/staying put might have been more practically free from such burdens).",

That person died without heirs, and the date of their death was the same as this young scoundrel's birth. He was astonished and realized the connection.

He was relieved from the duty by a prominent official named Gu. Both fulfilled 'a tiger-headed person calls out.'

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: During the Shaoxing era of the Song Dynasty, Shi Yisheng from Fujian was captured by rebels. He escaped by various means and took refuge in Huai Shang, where he drew this lot. He then went to the Jin state and offered strategies. The Jin ruler promoted him to a high position, and he eventually became a Left Chancellor. When sent as an envoy to the Song state, he leaked military intelligence and was convicted. This fulfilled 'a southern bird takes refuge in a northern nest.'\n\nDuring the Wuchen year of Tongzhi's reign (Qing Dynasty, 1868), I and several scholar friends from five counties drew this lot together. Later, only Yang Sheng from Nan'an, who sat in the East examination hall, was successful. This also corresponded to 'a solitary southern bird.' Noted by Zhuping.",

He subsequently failed repeatedly and ended his career with three terms as a local teacher, fulfilling 'by the blue lamp and yellow scrolls.'\n\nIn the Jiazi year of Tongzhi's reign (Qing Dynasty, 1864), Zhangzhou city in Fujian was captured by the Taiping rebels. General Lin, a military commander, was about to lead troops to suppress them and first drew this lot. The outcome was indeed unfavorable, fulfilling the third line of the prophecy.",

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar, priding himself on his wide social connections, traveled all year round. The funds he obtained were often robbed, or when he brought back goods, he suffered significant losses. After drawing this lot, he made a determined effort to study hard and was eventually recommended for a government stipend. Later, he became an official through his classical scholarship. This fulfilled the fourth line.\n\nChen Sheng of Quanzhou was very poor when he was just over twenty. During the Guichou year (1853) of Xianfeng's reign, for an annual examination, a friend wanted to hire him to ghostwrite in the examination hall, and an agreement was made. His mother found out and forbade him. He then went to the temple for guidance and drew this lot. Heeding both the divine message and his mother's command, he refused. That year, Chen Sheng ranked first in both classical studies and official document sections and secured a government stipend. This fulfilled the last two lines, with '岁廪 (suilin - yearly granary/stipend)' being particularly accurate.",
    "整体运程": "Stick to your duties, cultivate diligently, and you will secure a stable life; no need to envy others' speculative windfalls.

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar drew this for admission to an academy and was subsequently selected (this might be a misinterpretation or a very subtle positive twist if 'ensnared by the law's net' is taken as being 'caught' or 'selected' for the academy roster, though generally inauspicious).\n\nAnother scholar drew this for an imperial examination. Although initially unsuccessful, he was later accepted through a supplementary selection. This corresponds to 'being ensnared by the law's net' (again, a potentially counter-intuitive positive interpretation if the 'net' is seen as the official list).",

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: In the past, Liu Bowen (Liu Ji, a famous strategist) drew this lot and subsequently assisted Emperor Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang) in founding the Ming Dynasty. He then resigned from his glorious position and retired into seclusion. This relates to the phrase 'autumn will be waning,' implying that it is difficult to remain long in a position of great fame. He retired to Chuzhou, which is also a 'tiger-headed' city (possibly due to its name or shape).\n\nLu Sheng of Quanzhou drew this for the provincial examination in the Xianfeng Jiwei year (1859) and ranked second as Jieyuan (top graduate).

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A Gong Sheng (tribute student) stayed in the capital for ten years. During an examination period, people urged him to take it. He happened to open a scroll, and a chicken scratched it. He then decided to seek an official appointment directly. Others insisted, so he drew this lot. He reviewed his studies again, took the exam, and ranked sixty-sixth, fulfilling the 'three times three before, and three times three after' (3x3=9, 6+6=12, but 66 is a direct number match). He was appointed as a judicial commissioner in Chenzhou, served one term, and then retired, fulfilling the second line as well.\n\nAnother tribute student from Nan'an wished to go to the capital for an official post and take the northern provincial examination. He drew this, then switched to the local provincial examination and surprisingly obtained a supplementary degree. He had repeatedly failed the capital examinations, thus 'formerly defeated,' so he should 'plan for the south' (local exam). 'Though strength wanes' implied a secondary position, and 'still capable of one more try' suited his supplementary degree.",

Calculating for civil, martial, and miscellaneous students, each student having three categories, it amounted to eight thousand copper cash. The prophecy's clear indication was thus fulfilled.\n\nIn the Jimao year of Guangxu's reign (Qing Dynasty, 1879), at a literary gathering at Nantai Temple in Quanzhou, Qiu Sheng of Jinjiang brought a book of divination slips and drew this lot with coins in the Dakui Hall (Hall of the Chief Star of Literature).

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A man, choosing a son-in-law, drew this lot and didn't understand it. Later, he found a son-in-law surnamed Feng, born in the Pig year. Qian (乾) symbolizes a horse, and Hai (亥) is the Pig; 'dragon's vein' (来龙 lailong) refers to an excellent son-in-law (乘龙乘婿 chenglong chengxu - riding a dragon, excellent son-in-law). The first line was remarkably fulfilled.",
    "整体运程": "Do you feel that your current choices or direction are somewhat off? Like building a house, location is crucial.

Zhao was originally incorruptible, and 'Zhao' (赵) sounds like '照 (zhao - illuminate),' fulfilling the meaning of 'bright moon illuminates.'\n\nIn the Jiazhi year of Tongzhi's reign (Qing Dynasty, 1864), during the Taiping Rebellion's capture of Zhangzhou city, Magistrate Ye Weilin of Jinjiang drew this lot. In the eleventh month, indeed, a High Commissioner (高提台 Gao Titai) led troops to suppress the rebels, fulfilling 'High hall' (Gao Tai 高台) and 'break through their machinations.'\n\nAnother woman, visiting relatives at the prefectural yamen entrance, lost a hairpin on her way back. She searched everywhere in vain and then went to the temple and drew this lot. Someone interpreted: 'Why not search again at your in-laws' place?' The woman followed this advice and indeed found it at the foot of the screen wall by her maternal relatives' gate. The silver hairpin was covered by filth, with only one end exposed, so passersby didn't notice it. This fulfilled 'should naturally be returned' with remarkable巧 (qiao - cleverness/coincidence).",

His peers told him, 'Zhang Juzheng (a powerful Grand Secretary) is in power. If you become his protégé, you can aim for Dingjia (top three ranks).' He refused and was placed at the end of the third rank. His peers again said, 'Quickly seek Zhang's favor, and you can be selected for the Hanlin Academy.'

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: Chen Dashi of Linchuan drew this in his youth. He only passed the provincial examination at fifty-seven, fulfilling 'a white horse crosses the river.' 'White horse' refers to Gengwu (year with Gengwu stem-branch, Geng is associated with white, Wu with horse). In Jiasu (year with Jiasu stem-branch), he became an envoy. Summoned to Ji'an to enfeoff a king, he returned in brocade robes. Ji'an was anciently Qianzhou; 'Qian' (虔) has a 'tiger head' (虎头), fulfilling the fourth line.\n\nChen Shiqing, a Mingjing (Classics Scholar) from Jinjiang, drew this in the spring of Gengshen year (1860) of Xianfeng's reign, when his father was gravely ill. He believed his father would surely recover. However, his father died on a Gengwu day in the Yin hour of the sixth lunar month that year. He then understood the first two lines indicated his father currently had no issues, but when the 'time not yet come' (referring to the sixth month) arrived, there was nothing to be done. The last two lines also subtly concealed the date and time. The depth of divine intent is often unfathomable to those not skilled in interpretation.",

Almost everyone in the populace was getting married, commodity prices soared, and he reaped huge profits.

    "远古预言": "For marriage and offspring, do not fret if they are delayed; just hold fast to your spirit and uphold the Buddha's teachings. Before forty years, retribution (karmic results) must manifest; when merit is complete and conduct perfected, a fragrant child (noble offspring) will arrive.",
    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A person, troubled by continuous rain, went to the temple to ask about sunny weather and drew this lot, not understanding its meaning. When the sky cleared, it was a 'full' day (a specific day in the lunar calendar). Moreover, the character '馨 (xīn - fragrant)' has a '日 (rì - sun/day)' component at the bottom; this is why it waited for a 'full' day for the sun to appear.\n\nIn the ninth year of Guangxu's reign (Qing Dynasty, 1883), Guo Sheng of Jinjiang, aged forty, went to the temple on New Year's Day to pray for wealth and academic honors and drew this lot, with no apparent fulfillment. In winter, he had a son whose birth date (month and day) was the same as his own. This fulfilled the third and fourth lines of the prophecy.\n\n A military student from Huian County, about to take an examination, drew this. He ranked tenth in the county list, twenty-sixth in the prefectural list. When the supervising official arrived, he ranked fourth. After all the celebratory banquets were over, he had another son. This also fulfilled the third and fourth lines. Note: '年前 (niánqián - before years)' sounds like '连前 (liánqián - consecutively before/together before)' in some dialects.",
    "整体运程": "Important milestones in life sometimes require patient waiting; do not be overly anxious. Your inner piety and continuous good deeds are key forces attracting blessings. When the time is ripe and merits are complete, good results will naturally descend, even exceeding expectations.",

The following year, he fell ill and died, fulfilling the first line.\n\nAnother person, aged fifty, drew this for academic honors and achieved prominence that year, fulfilling the second line of the poem.\n\nFor diviners, one must consider the auspiciousness and decline of heavenly timing, the advance and retreat, survival and demise of human affairs, and combine these for interpretation. For academic honors, it is only favorable for those over fifty; otherwise, unfavorable.",

    "解读举例": "Example Interpretation: A scholar changed from the southern academy to the northern salt administration and repeatedly failed examinations. He drew this lot, believing he would succeed in a Rabbit (Mao) year examination in the capital, but it didn't happen. Later, he only received a provincial recommendation in a Rooster (You) year. He then realized that his two examiners, both from the same department, were born in Rabbit years, thus fulfilling 'when the Jade Rabbit arrives.'\n\nAnother person's son contracted a severe case of smallpox in the spring of Gengyin year (Qing Dynasty, Guangxu era). After the matter concluded, he went to the temple again to inquire about the timing of a rash, for prevention, and drew this lot. Indeed, in the Xinmao year (Rabbit year), second month, the rash appeared. This fulfilled 'when the Jade Rabbit arrives, you shall find success' and 'encountering spring again.'",

He willingly accepted a 'cool' (less sought-after) post, hoping for a long tenure.\n\nAnother person, after passing an examination, drew this lot. He failed to advance for a long time, until his former teacher became a Grand Secretary and presided over the examinations; only then did he succeed, fulfilling the third and fourth lines.\n\nAnother merchant, talented but unsupported, had his master predict his certain failure. He drew this lot, wishing to accept an offer from the Su family at Haikou but couldn't. He then worked for the Huang family on Fengge Street. Just as he was completing his first year and the shop was about to open, the Su family offered him a much better deal. He then established a large business on a major thoroughfare.
